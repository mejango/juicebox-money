# Full parity build (user 2026-07-16: "do them all", incl. split hooks +
# per-chain payout amounts & item supply)

Order minimizes rework. Commit per batch; Sepolia sims per encoding change.

- [x] B1 P5 issuance base currency (ETH/USD choice; project-wide, encodes
      per-ruleset — website has per-stage granularity, ours is one choice)
- [x] B2 smalls: P17 custom cash-out tax %, P16 tags, P18 ToS checkbox,
      P19 25MB media
- [x] B3 flavor batch: P12 custom approval-hook address (+per-chain),
      P13 router terminal toggle, P15 per-chain owner/operator, P14 verify
      custom token on every selected chain
- [x] B4 splits batch: P10 split locks (fixed-duration stages),
      P11 pay vs add-to-balance for project payout splits, split HOOK
      recipients (custom hook addr + optional projectId/beneficiary; Fund
      market LP option for reserved splits)
- [x] B5 P4 surplus allowance: capped amount + currency; owner-surplus
      toggle alongside routed payouts
- [x] B6 P2 multi-token payouts (per-context modes/amounts) + per-chain
      payout AMOUNT overrides (website has data model only; jango adds UI
      there)
- [x] B7 store batch: P8 categories, P9 per-item flags + voting units,
      per-chain item supply overrides, P7 revnet operator store
      permissions, P6 revnet auto-issuances
- [x] B8 P1 suckers/chain linking (CCIP via SDK parseSuckerDeployerConfig; omnichain deployer for linked projects): bridge choice (native/ccip/both),
      parseSuckerDeployerConfig both flavors, omnichain deployer + shared
      salt for projects
- [ ] B9 P3 Relayr pay-once — DECISION FOR USER: keep per-chain signing
      (simple, no third-party dependency, works today) or integrate
      Relayr's bundle API (one gas payment, but adds quote/refund flow +
      external service dependency). website has Relayr; jbm could keep
      per-chain as a deliberate simplification.
- [ ] P20 network toggle: SKIPPED as architecture — jbm is env-scoped per
      network (bendystraw + wagmi config baked per deployment); flag for
      user sign-off
- [ ] B10 native-bridge suckers — WAITING ON SDK: juice-sdk-v4@91c2361
      (user flagged 2026-07-16, about to land) adds
      bridge: 'ccip' (default) | 'native' | 'both' to
      parseSuckerDeployerConfig. Once jbm bumps the SDK, consider website's
      bridge selector. Rules: 'native'+USDC accounting throws ('both'
      auto-keeps USDC on CCIP); native = Ethereum↔L2 pairs only, so L2↔L2
      selections fall back to CCIP. Current no-bridge-arg call is
      unaffected by the bump (defaults to ccip).

Watch: website/ baseline a1ef87b (see memory jb-jbm-website-parity-watch).
